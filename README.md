# Getting started with an npm project

Note: this not about using 3p code in your own app

1. come to have the code (e.g. clone repo)
1. from command line in that directory (i.e. the one that has the package.json file), run `npm i`
1. you're ready to roll, so in the case of this project which is built with vite, you could now do like `npm run dev`
